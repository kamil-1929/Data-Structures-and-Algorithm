# Practicing pandas and numpy arrays for data manipulation purposes only for now
# as it helps performance and ease of use for data manipulation
# Pandas is a library that provides data structures and data analysis tools for Python programming language
# and data manipulation tools for data analysis tasks.
# it helps in Data structures like Series and DataFrame objects that are built on top of NumPy.

# Using numpy for numerical operations
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd

# Creating a sample dataframe
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
array = np.array(numbers)
print(array)
mean = np.mean(array)
print(mean)
